              <strong>Project:</strong> MIT App Inventor
              <br>
              <strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principles
              <br>
              <strong>Time Given:</strong> 1 1/2 of a week given
              <br>
              <strong>Purpose</strong> Construct our own version of the application with our own edits
              <br>
              <br>
              
              <p>One of the projects that I have created during my Computer Science Principles class was a project where we were able to create our own verson of an app.</p>

              <p>Using MIT App Inventor, the project was very easily completed. In collboration wih Pravav Viswanathan, we were able to create new features that is typically not in a painting app. Although the MIT App Inventor was a new software for me, it is very similar to a different software we used called Scratch.</p>
            
              <p> Between the two of us, I was mainly the coder and editor, while Pravav did most of the all the organizing/planning. When we were first starting off this project, we wanted users to have a simple, yet having a variety of features that won't confuse users when using the app. At the start of the project, we only had red, blue, and green. We ended up adding violet, which gave a little bit more variety, as well as the creation of the RGB button. The RGB button allows the user to select a randomly given color for them to use each time they click on the button.</p>
